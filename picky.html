        <h3>Picking your Promise Poison</h3>
        <h5>(or, "how Peter Piper Picked a Peck of Petulant Promise Poison")<h5>

        <p>
            The frameworks shown are by no means the only implementations of promises in
            Javascript. They are just the two most popular and a peek at how it can be done, for
            interest' sake
        </p>
        <p>Of course, the question arises: <i><b>How do I select the promise library to use?</b></i></p>
        <p>Well, as with most tools, pick the one which is most convenient.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you're in a project with only jQuery, use $.Deferred. Just bear in mind you have to
                catch exceptions and reject() with them, as need be.</li>
            <li>If you're in a Node application, you probably want Q (or something similar). No point
                bringing in the whole of jQuery for an environment where the DOM is often irrelevant.</li>
            <li>If you're in an Angular application, I'd suggest using the inbuilt, slightly cut-down
                version of Q that is provided with the service <code>$q</code>. The <code>$http</code>
                service uses it anyway -- and I'd also suggest steering away from using the extended
                <code>$http</code> methods (<code>fail</code> and <code>success</code>) as they just
                introduce inconsistency and a potential for confusion</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Interestingly, these different promise frameworks play quite well with each other, as the
            following example demonstrates</p>
